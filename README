This is a personal passion project of mine that is meant to be easy to program.

It is also meant to be fun.

How fun it is, and how easy it is, remains to be seen. I'm just starting out.

So far it's been both. I hope you enjoy it as well.

My goals are to practice writing "good code" and also to practice unit testing. Check out test_index.py to see the tests
(at the moment it is still that small).

I can't promise to update this readme. That's not one of the specifications I've set for myself.
Good code, good tests, hopefully fun. Enjoy!

To run:
python3 index.py from the linux command line.
